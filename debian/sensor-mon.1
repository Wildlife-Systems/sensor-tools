.TH SENSOR\-MON 1 "January 2026" "sensor-tools" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
sensor\-mon \- ncurses-based sensor monitoring interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sensor\-mon
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sensor\-mon
provides an interactive ncurses-based terminal interface for monitoring
sensor data from sensor-* applications.
.PP
The tool scans for executable sensor-* programs in the PATH, verifies
they respond correctly to the "identify" command, and allows real-time
monitoring of their output with a graphical display.
.SH USAGE
When started, sensor\-mon displays a list of available sensors.
Use number keys (1-9) to select a sensor to monitor.
.PP
In sensor view mode:
.TP
.B b
Return to the main sensor list.
.TP
.B [
Show previous result (for sensors with multiple readings).
.TP
.B ]
Show next result (for sensors with multiple readings).
.TP
.B q
Quit the program.
.SH DISPLAY
The sensor view shows:
.TP
.B Top half
Formatted JSON output from the selected sensor.
.TP
.B Bottom half
Real-time graph of the "value" field, updated every second.
The graph shows min/max range and plots the most recent readings.
.SH SENSOR REQUIREMENTS
For a sensor application to be detected by sensor\-mon, it must:
.TP
1.
Be named with the prefix "sensor-" (e.g., sensor-dht22, sensor-ds18b20).
.TP
2.
Be executable and in the system PATH.
.TP
3.
Exit with status code 60 when called with the "identify" argument.
.TP
4.
Output JSON data when called with the "all" argument.
.SH EXAMPLE
.EX
# Start sensor monitoring
sensor\-mon

# The interface will display available sensors:
# ws-sensors - Select a sensor to view data
# Found 3 working sensor-* apps
#   sensor-dht22
#   sensor-ds18b20
#   sensor-bmp280
#
# Press 1, 2, or 3 to select a sensor
.EE
.SH NOTES
.B sensor\-mon
requires ncurses support and is designed for Unix-like systems.
The program updates sensor readings every second when viewing a sensor.
.PP
Color support is used when available:
.TP
.B Green
Frame and borders
.TP
.B Blue
Graph data points and lines
.TP
.B Reversed
